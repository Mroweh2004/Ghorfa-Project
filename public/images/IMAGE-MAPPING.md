<!-- Character Image Reference Guide -->
# Quick Visual Reference

## Image Mapping (from your uploaded images)

```
Image 1 (Waving - hand up)          → character-wave-1.png
Image 2 (Waving - hand on hip)      → character-wave-2.png  
Image 3 (Adjusting tie)             → character-tie.png
Image 4 (Facepalm/glasses)          → character-facepalm.png
Image 5 (OK gesture)                → character-ok.png
Image 6 (Thumbs down)               → character-thumbs-down.png
Image 7 (Holding phone)             → character-phone.png
Image 8 (Thinking - chin)           → character-thinking.png
```

## Priority Images (Must Have)

These 4 images are actively used in the current design:

1. **character-wave-1.png** (Image 1) - Hero sections
2. **character-tie.png** (Image 3) - Basic info steps  
3. **character-phone.png** (Image 7) - Location & Images steps
4. **character-thinking.png** (Image 8) - Progress helper & Details step
5. **character-wave-2.png** (Image 2) - Amenities step

## Optional Images (For Future Features)

These can be added later for enhanced UX:

- **character-ok.png** (Image 5) - Success messages
- **character-thumbs-down.png** (Image 6) - Error states
- **character-facepalm.png** (Image 4) - Validation errors

## Installation Steps

1. Download/save the 8 images from your chat
2. Rename them according to the mapping above
3. Copy all to: `c:\Ghorfa-Project\public\images\`
4. Refresh your browser - characters will appear automatically!

## Fallback Behavior

If images are missing, the design still works:
- Alt text displays instead of images
- Layout remains intact
- No JavaScript errors occur

The character system enhances the UX but doesn't break the site if images are unavailable.
